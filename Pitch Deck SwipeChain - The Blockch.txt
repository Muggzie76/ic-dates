Design Notes
Color Scheme: Blue (#1E90FF) for headers and trust elements (e.g., “Verified” badges), red (#FF4500) for CTAs and highlights (e.g., “See Now” buttons), white (#FFFFFF) for backgrounds to keep it clean and modern. This reflects the “I see you now” clarity while boosting acquisition per color psychology research.

Typography: Use a playful yet bold sans-serif like Poppins for titles (e.g., “ICUNOW”), paired with a sleek font like Open Sans for body text, reinforcing visibility and readability.

Visuals: Incorporate eye motifs subtly (e.g., in the logo or blockchain nodes) to tie into “I see you now,” alongside swipe cards and token icons for familiarity.
